# Todos
- [POKER-2] Make a list of stories available 
- [POKER-3] Basic server persistence
  - Pickles should be enough. 
- [POKER-4] Setup js-linter to allow console usage
- [POKER-5] Make session survive page reload
     Tough. JWT Token should not be stored in local storage. HTTPOnly Session

- [POKER-6] Add feature to remove users  
- [POKER-7] Add nginx-setup.
     This might solve the session issues. 
- [POKER-66] Consider adding tests...
